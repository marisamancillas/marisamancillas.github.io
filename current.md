As a graduate student and research assistant with the Dr. Fuentes-Soriano [Herbarium Lab]([https://link-url-here.org](https://aces.nmsu.edu/herbarium/index.html)), I've had the opportunity diversify my skillset. My research project involves datamining, datascience, programming in R []([]), as well as collecting plant specimens, implementing sampling designs, and collecting Asessment inventory and Monitoring data. 

My research project is about understanding if and how plant species are shifting their distributions in association with changing climatic conditions over time in the Organ Mountains of South-Central New Mexico. For this project I harmonize multiple biodiversity repository databases for species occurences in my study area
