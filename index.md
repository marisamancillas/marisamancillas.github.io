Hi, my name is Marisa! I am a field botanist interested in the ecology of rangelands and prairie ecosystems. Currently, I am in a rangeland ecology masters program at New Mexico State University, studying biogeographic shifts among plant communities in association with climate change and along elevation gradients. 
 
Before graduate school I worked in 10 Western U.S. states on wetland mitigation, reclamation, and restoration sites as a field manager, crew leader, and technician. I have also worked on rangeland inventories and invasive species surveys, and endangered plant species monitoring projects. 

**Interests:** rangeland ecology, botany, ecology, restoration, historical ecology, ethnobotany, gardening, leadership, and mentoring.
